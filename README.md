# Emoji CSS :smiley:

An easy way to include emoji from Apple 10.2 in your HTML. Inspired by [Emoji CSS](https://afeld.github.io/emoji-css/); site ripped off of [Emoji Cheat Sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/).

## Running Locally

```bash
bundle
bundle exec jekyll serve -w
open http://localhost:4000
```
